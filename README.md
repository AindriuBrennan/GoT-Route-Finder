# GoT-Route-Finder
This was a group assignment completed by Gianlucca and myself for Data Structures and Algorithms 2.
The main purpose of this assignment was to create a custom graph data structure and gain understanding on how to
traverse and search the graph using dijkstras algorithm. We also used Yens algorithm for finding multiple paths 
between starting point and end point.
